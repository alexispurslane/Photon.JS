# Photon.JS
## A simple, smart, and easy to use library for working with the Spark Photon board.

For those of us that don't want to directly deal with a REST API and all that is associated with that, and just want an easy to use and well-designed libary, this is the libary for them!

For more documentation on what exactly these functions return, and how the Photon works, see [the Photon Reference Docs](https://docs.particle.io/reference/api/)
